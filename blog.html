                                <br> <br> <br>
                             <p>Names matter! We build one of the closest associations with our names from early on in our lives. Our names are an integral part of our identity. Our names have rich and intimate personal stories. Names evoke emotions far more complex than our words can do justice to describe. Calling someone properly by their name ‚Äì especially when that name is not very familiar to your ears ‚Äì is an act of recognizing the uniqueness of each individual and respecting their personal stories.
                            </p>
                            <p>Implications of the name go beyond our identity. In a 2018 study conducted by Ryerson University and the University of Toronto, researchers sent out almost 13,000 fake resumes to over 3,000 postings. The data showed that the fictitious candidates with Chinese, Indian or Pakistani-sounding names were 28% less likely to get invited to an interview than those with English-sounding names, even when their qualifications were identical. The same study was done in 2011 and the name bias was 35% strong (we made 7% progress in 7 years).
                            </p>
                            <p>To avoid discrimination (or to fit in), many Asians adopt English names; many South Asians anglicize their names. In my first job in Canada as a customer support representative, I had an anglicized name ‚Äì from Firoze to Roz ‚Äì so that clients could say or remember it easily. I felt strange (cognitive dissonance ‚Äîmental discomfort experienced for holding contradictory identities) every time I said: "Roz speaking". I had no association with that name; it was not part of my identity. As an immigrant without any pre-existing social network in Canada, I desperately wanted to fit in to integrate, which caused me to compromise my authentic self. I can tell you confidently: it didn't help!
                            </p>
                            <p>As Canadians, we take pride in our multiculturalism and believe it to be a ‚Äúmosaic society‚Äù. John Porter, one of the most prominent Canadian sociologists, debunked this myth in his groundbreaking book, The Vertical Mosaic. It was the first comprehensive, empirically-detailed, theoretically-informed study of the national structure of class and power in Canada. I believe it is perhaps one of the most important books ever written by a Canadian sociologist. Before Porter published his book, the Canadian society was believed to be democratic and egalitarian where anyone (irrespective of their background) could ‚Äúmake it‚Äù.</p>
                            
                            <p>Unless we take an honest look at where we stand now, it is perhaps very hard to dedicate our energy towards our desired destination ‚Äì one that is truly diverse and inclusive. I believe learning to respect the names of our colleagues is a step towards a more equitable and just workplace.

                               <p>From June 4 to June 5, Muslims across Canada celebrated Eid-ul-Fitr. Practicing Muslims fast every day from sunrise to sunset for one month that ends with the celebration of Eid-ul-Fitr. Depending on your geo-location and when Ramadan begins (Ramadan is dependent on the lunar calendar), you could fast between 11 hours (Argentina) to 21 hours (Murmansk of Russia). In other words, this year, fasting Muslims in Russia did not even drink water for 21 hours every day.
                               </p>

                               <p>I was born in a Muslim family in a small village in Bangladesh. Fasting is obligatory for all healthy Muslims from the age of 12. I have vivid memories of fasting during summer days as a teenager, especially when I had to walk almost 10 kilometres every day to attend school. I have worked as a high school guidance counsellor at a Bangladeshi community school in Saudi Arabia, where I worked with fasting teenagers. It is not easy for teenagers to fast when their body growing fast, and the need for nutrition is critical for the mental work of academia. I know stories of many Bangladeshi construction workers fainting while labouring under the unforgiving desert sun, yet they denied to break their fast.
                            </p>
                            <p>I invite the readers to pause for a minute and reflect on the significance of Ramadan for Muslims for two interconnected reasons. First, we humans are storytelling beings. World-renowned historian Harrari argues that humans, in their 2.5 million years of evolution, have ascended over other stronger animal by collaborating with each other. Our shared stories enable us to define who we are and collaborate with those who also share ‚Äúour stories.‚Äù Second, if collaboration is a quintessential element of remaining competitive in an industry that is disruptive in nature (such as the tech industry), and you have a (or many) Muslim colleague(s), it is perhaps critical for you to know their stories that define their sense of self for better collaboration.
                            </p>
                             <p>I can say with some confidence, at least in the North American context, your Muslim colleagues perhaps know more about Christmas than you know about Ramadan or Eid-ul-Fitr. I will argue that this is an opportunity to put on your diversity and inclusion hat and find ways to make your workplace more inclusive by encouraging empathy, education, respect and understanding.
                            </p>
                            <p>You might say (and rightfully so), ‚ÄúWe have policies for allowing religious holidays.‚Äù I am sure your colleagues of different faith sincerely appreciate it. I believe if you knew what Ramadan and Eid-ul-Fitr meant to your Muslim colleagues, you would be able to be respectful towards them in your acts and words for the entire month and create many moments of belonging for them. For instance, if you would avoid eating and drinking during meetings with your Muslim colleagues who are fasting and also love the food you are enjoying; this could be an act of respecting their faith. You are not required to do so, but this could be a way to earn their trust because you respect their story, contributing to many subsequent successful collaborations.</p>

                            <p>In his book Behave, Stanford professor and neurobiologist Robert Sapolsky showed that we humans have evolved to think in terms of ‚Äúus-versus-them.‚Äù It is our shared stories that create the boundary between ‚Äúus‚Äù and ‚Äúthem.‚Äù Professor Sapolsky also gives examples of extraordinary events in human history that shows this boundary is malleable, such as the Christmas Truce during the First World War, which brought soldiers from both ends together to exchange gifts and celebrate Christmas because they had a shared story: their Christmas. I believe, if you take an active interest in learning the stories of your colleagues, miracles can happen!

                              <p> We long to belong! Humans have evolved with the deepest desire to be part of something bigger than themselves. </p>
                                
                              <p> It is perhaps easier to belong to a group if you look alike, speak the same language, and laugh at jokes you understand mutually. However, the same joke you are laughing to tears over may puzzle someone who is struggling to understand the reference. It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that this outsider who doesn‚Äôt look like you, who did not grow up speaking the same language or laughing at the same jokes, also wants to belong.
                            </p>
                            <p> In response to our deep desire to belong, many try to fit in, which often leads to the opposite of their intended result ‚Äì not embracing their true selves, it makes them feel even lonelier. Fitting in is very different from being our authentic selves. I will argue when companies create a conducive culture where employees are encouraged to be their authentic selves (instead of fitting in), it caters to our desire to belong and creates loyalty to the workplace. A sense of loyalty and belonging has benefits beyond monetary rewards.  
                            </p>

                            <p>I will try to explain further with a personal anecdote. I was born in a small village in Bangladesh and I came to Canada for graduate studies in 2014. Some of my colleagues at Hubdoc are from India. My Hindi is far from perfect, but when I speak in Hindi with my Indian colleagues, I experience an ineffable comfort due to Hindi‚Äôs proximity to my mother tongue, Bangla. At times, I feel self-conscious when I see my English-speaking colleagues around me. I second guess myself. I question ‚Äì is it rude of me to speak in Hindi in the office?</p>
                           <p>I then land on a few follow-up questions: am I trying to fit in? Is my fear of being rude rooted in a desire to fit in? And do I really belong if I cannot speak in a language which brings me comfort?
                        </p>
                        <p>This is my conviction: our diversity not only makes us richer in ideas; if cared for and nurtured well, it has the capability to instill within us with a precious sense of belonging.

                               <p> Confidence is often treated as one of the key determining factors from hiring to promoting employees. Is it time to stretch our imagination to reevaluate our confidence addiction? Let me contest one specific element of confidence ‚Äîarticulation and presentation skill. </p>

                               <p> If our everyday life experiences shape who we are, how does the life experiences of women, people of colour, queer people and other marginalized groups impact their art of articulation and presentation skills? If I am a white, able-bodied, anglophone, heterosexual male; chances are higher that I haven‚Äôt had to go through experiences of discrimination for embodying these attributes. But, it is well-known that the absence of these attributes can result in discrimination.  Now I invite us to imagine if we judge someone‚Äôs presentation skills, do we take the above-mentioned attributes into consideration.
                               </p>

                               <p> It is a research-backed well-known fact, women don‚Äôt put their hand up for promotions despite having the competence. Research shows women leaders are better listeners, compassionate, and lead with integrity comparing to their male counterpart. Yet few women are in the leadership roles in most companies, and I will argue, many women are not given their due position ‚Äúfor lacking confidence.‚Äù I will leave the readers with the question: should we prioritize confidence over competence?  If you go through experiences of delegitimization; if you are silenced regularly; if you are subject to discrimination; will it not plunge you in self-doubt.
                            </p>
