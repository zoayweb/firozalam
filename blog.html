                        <br> <br> <br>
                        <p>Names matter! We build one of the closest associations with our names from early on in our
                            lives. Our names are an integral part of our identity. Our names have rich and intimate
                            personal stories. Names evoke emotions far more complex than our words can do justice to
                            describe. Calling someone properly by their name ‚Äì especially when that name is not very
                            familiar to your ears ‚Äì is an act of recognizing the uniqueness of each individual and
                            respecting their personal stories.
                        </p>
                        <p>Implications of the name go beyond our identity. In a 2018 study conducted by Ryerson
                            University and the University of Toronto, researchers sent out almost 13,000 fake resumes to
                            over 3,000 postings. The data showed that the fictitious candidates with Chinese, Indian or
                            Pakistani-sounding names were 28% less likely to get invited to an interview than those with
                            English-sounding names, even when their qualifications were identical. The same study was
                            done in 2011 and the name bias was 35% strong (we made 7% progress in 7 years).
                        </p>
                        <p>To avoid discrimination (or to fit in), many Asians adopt English names; many South Asians
                            anglicize their names. In my first job in Canada as a customer support representative, I had
                            an anglicized name ‚Äì from Firoze to Roz ‚Äì so that clients could say or remember it easily. I
                            felt strange (cognitive dissonance ‚Äîmental discomfort experienced for holding contradictory
                            identities) every time I said: "Roz speaking". I had no association with that name; it was
                            not part of my identity. As an immigrant without any pre-existing social network in Canada,
                            I desperately wanted to fit in to integrate, which caused me to compromise my authentic
                            self. I can tell you confidently: it didn't help!
                        </p>
                        <p>As Canadians, we take pride in our multiculturalism and believe it to be a ‚Äúmosaic society‚Äù.
                            John Porter, one of the most prominent Canadian sociologists, debunked this myth in his
                            groundbreaking book, The Vertical Mosaic. It was the first comprehensive,
                            empirically-detailed, theoretically-informed study of the national structure of class and
                            power in Canada. I believe it is perhaps one of the most important books ever written by a
                            Canadian sociologist. Before Porter published his book, the Canadian society was believed to
                            be democratic and egalitarian where anyone (irrespective of their background) could ‚Äúmake
                            it‚Äù.</p>

                        <p>Unless we take an honest look at where we stand now, it is perhaps very hard to dedicate our
                            energy towards our desired destination ‚Äì one that is truly diverse and inclusive. I believe
                            learning to respect the names of our colleagues is a step towards a more equitable and just
                            workplace.

                        <p>June is a special month of celebrating diversity for Canadians. It is our month for
                            celebrating pride and National Indigenous Peoples Day. I am a proud Torontonian. I want to
                            take this opportunity to think together with the reader about the diversity issues in the
                            tech industry, focusing on Indigenous Peoples.</p>
                        <p>The age of the algorithm has made its way from Hollywood fiction to the highways of decision
                            making that significantly impacts our lives. These decisions range from the length of a
                            prison sentence (COMPAS, a risk assessment algorithm used by the state of Wisconsin) to the
                            premiums of health insurance. Simply put, we now live in an algorithm assisted (and dictated
                            in some cases) world. It is critical for us to reflect on who codes the algorithms that can
                            significantly impact individuals. The central thesis of this article is <i> if the ubiquity
                                of algorithms in our lives is just a fact, it is critical that people who are regularly
                                pushed to the margins are brought in the center to have a say in designing these
                                powerful algorithms.</i></p>
                        <p>In her book, ‚ÄòWeapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens
                            Democracy,‚Äô mathematician and former Director of the Lede Program in Data Practices at
                            Columbia University, Cathy O‚ÄôNeil shows how algorithms are reinforcing discrimination in the
                            guise of machine neutrality. If an algorithm deems a black woman too risky based on the
                            postal code of her residence, she can be denied a much-needed loan.</p>
                        <p>Professor O‚ÄôNeil asserts that training data is one of the critical determinants of decisions
                            made by algorithmic models. If the training data is biased (as found in numerous studies),
                            algorithms will further consolidate the discrimination that has shaped our history for
                            centuries. Winston Churchill said history (in this case, data that trains algorithmic
                            models) is written by the victors. I ask the readers a simple question: Do the victors keep
                            an accurate record of their victims (women, queer people, people with disabilities, people
                            of colour, Indigenous Peoples, and other marginalized groups) to train their tools
                            (algorithms) to ensure fairness? Professor O‚ÄôNeil argues algorithms are opinions written in
                            computer codes. Diversity in tech can ensure writing code responsibly and improving training
                            data sets. As we lack diversity in tech, writing responsible code or improving training data
                            sets are deprioritized, leading to discriminatory outcomes.</p>
                        <p>The founder of Girls Who Code, Reshma Saujani, believes ‚ÄúCoding is the language of the
                            future, and every girl should learn it.‚Äù In April of 2019, the US lawmakers introduced
                            algorithmic accountability bill that would require companies to examine for biases embedded
                            in the machine learning-powered systems. Mutale Nkonde, an A.I governance expert, has been
                            one of the key contributors in shaping the algorithmic accountability bill. In her recent
                            article, Nkonde shows the sheer absence of diversity in the A.I field. She writes Google
                            machine intelligence team lists 893 people, only one among them is a black woman, and
                            Facebook has none. The marginalized groups need the capability to demand algorithmic
                            accountability and expose the black box (algorithmic models) of decision making for ensuring
                            equity and fairness.</p>
                        <p>Let me bring your attention to the representation of Indigenous Peoples in tech and my
                            ignorance about Indigenous Peoples. I knew very little about the Indigenous Peoples when I
                            came to Canada in 2014. As a Social Justice graduate student, I had the privilege of
                            learning from many indigenous scholars of Canada. I was baffled by the depth of my
                            ignorance. What I found equally baffling is that many of my Canadian friends and a large
                            number of immigrants shared my ignorance about Indigenous Peoples. I learned about the
                            history of Residential Schools of Canada designed for ‚ÄòKilling the Indian in the Child‚Äô: the
                            violent history of European assimilation of Indigenous Peoples. I had the privilege of
                            attending conferences of Indigenous scholars in Canada. I met survivors of Residential
                            Schools; we wept together, mourning the loss of Indigenous languages, cultures, and
                            histories.</p>
                        <p>The lack of gender diversity in tech is well known, and when it comes to Indigenous Peoples,
                            the statistics can get a little too painful to process. I wanted to understand what the
                            diversity data says about indigenous peoples. I decided to dig deep in the diversity data
                            published in the company sites of the following tech giants and found the following: Google
                            (2019) ‚Äî 0.8%, Apple (2018) ‚Äî 1%, Amazon (2019) ‚Äî 0.7%, Airbnb (2018) ‚Äî 0.24%, Microsoft
                            (2018) ‚Äî 0.2%. Indigenous Peoples are the least represented group in tech.</p>
                        <p>Indigenous women are further marginalized in this extreme minority. These numbers speak
                            louder than any voice ever could: Facebook and Netflix could not publish any data that holds
                            even a small numeric significance. When it comes to navigating through the diversity
                            discussions, the beauty of data is that it bluntly tells the story, without resorting to
                            euphemism or sugarcoating. While indigenous populations might be small as a percentage, the
                            tools often used to train Machine Learning systems can end up erasing them completely, and
                            the main defence against this is having people from those communities visible in tech.</p>
                        <p>We are living in a world that is exponentially becoming digital, and the digital divide
                            disproportionally impacts Indigenous Peoples. The history of European settlement for
                            centuries has brutally plunged the Indigenous Peoples into all kinds of dehumanizing
                            discriminations. While physical European colonialism ended in most parts of the world;
                            it is very much an ongoing project in places like North America. If the world we are
                            creating and curating is becoming increasingly digital, it is crucial that we do not
                            push the Indigenous Peoples to ‚Äòdigital disenfranchisement‚Äô again through discriminatory
                            algorithms and lack of access to a growing and influential set of industries. Professor
                            Donna Haraway, a feminist scholar in the field of science and technology studies, says
                            in her book Staying with the Trouble, ‚Äúit matters what stories we tell to tell other
                            stories with‚Ä¶ It matters what stories make worlds, what worlds make stories.‚Äù I think it
                            is high time we ask ourselves: Are we conscious of the Indigenous Peoples as we write
                            (code) the stories (algorithms) that make our digital world?</p>
                        <p>In 2015, Justice Murray Sinclair, said, ‚ÄúWhat took place in residential schools (in
                            Canada) amounts to nothing short of cultural genocide.‚Äù The findings of the 6-year-long
                            Truth and Reconciliation Report that included the testimonies of almost 7000 witnesses,
                            echoes the statement of Justice Sinclair. I recognize the wound is fresh, and shame is
                            almost insurmountable, but we must remember: If we do not actively voice our concerns
                            about the painful absence of Indigenous Peoples in tech, we are on our way to repeating
                            the history in the digital realm. In the words of professor Eliezer Wiesel, Nobel
                            Laureate writer and Holocaust survivor, ‚ÄúWe must take sides. Neutrality helps the
                            oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.‚Äù</p>

                        <p>From June 4 to June 5, Muslims across Canada celebrated Eid-ul-Fitr. Practicing Muslims fast
                            every day from sunrise to sunset for one month that ends with the celebration of
                            Eid-ul-Fitr. Depending on your geo-location and when Ramadan begins (Ramadan is dependent on
                            the lunar calendar), you could fast between 11 hours (Argentina) to 21 hours (Murmansk of
                            Russia). In other words, this year, fasting Muslims in Russia did not even drink water for
                            21 hours every day.
                        </p>

                        <p>I was born in a Muslim family in a small village in Bangladesh. Fasting is obligatory for all
                            healthy Muslims from the age of 12. I have vivid memories of fasting during summer days as a
                            teenager, especially when I had to walk almost 10 kilometres every day to attend school. I
                            have worked as a high school guidance counsellor at a Bangladeshi community school in Saudi
                            Arabia, where I worked with fasting teenagers. It is not easy for teenagers to fast when
                            their body growing fast, and the need for nutrition is critical for the mental work of
                            academia. I know stories of many Bangladeshi construction workers fainting while labouring
                            under the unforgiving desert sun, yet they denied to break their fast.
                        </p>
                        <p>I invite the readers to pause for a minute and reflect on the significance of Ramadan for
                            Muslims for two interconnected reasons. First, we humans are storytelling beings.
                            World-renowned historian Harrari argues that humans, in their 2.5 million years of
                            evolution, have ascended over other stronger animal by collaborating with each other. Our
                            shared stories enable us to define who we are and collaborate with those who also share ‚Äúour
                            stories.‚Äù Second, if collaboration is a quintessential element of remaining competitive in
                            an industry that is disruptive in nature (such as the tech industry), and you have a (or
                            many) Muslim colleague(s), it is perhaps critical for you to know their stories that define
                            their sense of self for better collaboration.
                        </p>
                        <p>I can say with some confidence, at least in the North American context, your Muslim
                            colleagues perhaps know more about Christmas than you know about Ramadan or Eid-ul-Fitr. I
                            will argue that this is an opportunity to put on your diversity and inclusion hat and find
                            ways to make your workplace more inclusive by encouraging empathy, education, respect and
                            understanding.
                        </p>
                        <p>You might say (and rightfully so), ‚ÄúWe have policies for allowing religious holidays.‚Äù I am
                            sure your colleagues of different faith sincerely appreciate it. I believe if you knew what
                            Ramadan and Eid-ul-Fitr meant to your Muslim colleagues, you would be able to be respectful
                            towards them in your acts and words for the entire month and create many moments of
                            belonging for them. For instance, if you would avoid eating and drinking during meetings
                            with your Muslim colleagues who are fasting and also love the food you are enjoying; this
                            could be an act of respecting their faith. You are not required to do so, but this could be
                            a way to earn their trust because you respect their story, contributing to many subsequent
                            successful collaborations.</p>

                        <p>In his book Behave, Stanford professor and neurobiologist Robert Sapolsky showed that we
                            humans have evolved to think in terms of ‚Äúus-versus-them.‚Äù It is our shared stories that
                            create the boundary between ‚Äúus‚Äù and ‚Äúthem.‚Äù Professor Sapolsky also gives examples of
                            extraordinary events in human history that shows this boundary is malleable, such as the
                            Christmas Truce during the First World War, which brought soldiers from both ends together
                            to exchange gifts and celebrate Christmas because they had a shared story: their Christmas.
                            I believe, if you take an active interest in learning the stories of your colleagues,
                            miracles can happen!

                        <p> We long to belong! Humans have evolved with the deepest desire to be part of something
                            bigger than themselves. </p>

                        <p> It is perhaps easier to belong to a group if you look alike, speak the same language, and
                            laugh at jokes you understand mutually. However, the same joke you are laughing to tears
                            over may puzzle someone who is struggling to understand the reference. It‚Äôs important to
                            keep in mind that this outsider who doesn‚Äôt look like you, who did not grow up speaking the
                            same language or laughing at the same jokes, also wants to belong.
                        </p>
                        <p> In response to our deep desire to belong, many try to fit in, which often leads to the
                            opposite of their intended result ‚Äì not embracing their true selves, it makes them feel even
                            lonelier. Fitting in is very different from being our authentic selves. I will argue when
                            companies create a conducive culture where employees are encouraged to be their authentic
                            selves (instead of fitting in), it caters to our desire to belong and creates loyalty to the
                            workplace. A sense of loyalty and belonging has benefits beyond monetary rewards.
                        </p>

                        <p>I will try to explain further with a personal anecdote. I was born in a small village in
                            Bangladesh and I came to Canada for graduate studies in 2014. Some of my colleagues at
                            Hubdoc are from India. My Hindi is far from perfect, but when I speak in Hindi with my
                            Indian colleagues, I experience an ineffable comfort due to Hindi‚Äôs proximity to my mother
                            tongue, Bangla. At times, I feel self-conscious when I see my English-speaking colleagues
                            around me. I second guess myself. I question ‚Äì is it rude of me to speak in Hindi in the
                            office?</p>
                        <p>I then land on a few follow-up questions: am I trying to fit in? Is my fear of being rude
                            rooted in a desire to fit in? And do I really belong if I cannot speak in a language which
                            brings me comfort?
                        </p>
                        <p>This is my conviction: our diversity not only makes us richer in ideas; if cared for and
                            nurtured well, it has the capability to instill within us with a precious sense of
                            belonging.

                        <p> Confidence is often treated as one of the key determining factors from hiring to promoting
                            employees. Is it time to stretch our imagination to reevaluate our confidence addiction? Let
                            me contest one specific element of confidence ‚Äîarticulation and presentation skill. </p>

                        <p> If our everyday life experiences shape who we are, how does the life experiences of women,
                            people of colour, queer people and other marginalized groups impact their art of
                            articulation and presentation skills? If I am a white, able-bodied, anglophone, heterosexual
                            male; chances are higher that I haven‚Äôt had to go through experiences of discrimination for
                            embodying these attributes. But, it is well-known that the absence of these attributes can
                            result in discrimination. Now I invite us to imagine if we judge someone‚Äôs presentation
                            skills, do we take the above-mentioned attributes into consideration.
                        </p>

                        <p> It is a research-backed well-known fact, women don‚Äôt put their hand up for promotions
                            despite having the competence. Research shows women leaders are better listeners,
                            compassionate, and lead with integrity comparing to their male counterpart. Yet few women
                            are in the leadership roles in most companies, and I will argue, many women are not given
                            their due position ‚Äúfor lacking confidence.‚Äù I will leave the readers with the question:
                            should we prioritize confidence over competence? If you go through experiences of
                            delegitimization; if you are silenced regularly; if you are subject to discrimination; will
                            it not plunge you in self-doubt.
